HDLC

HDLC (High-level Data Link Control) is a group of protocols for transmitting synchronous data packets between point to point nodes. 
In this controller, data is organized into frames. 
HDLC protocol resides with Layer 2 of the OSI model, the data link layer. 
It make use of zero insertion/deletion process (bit stuffing) to ensure that the bit pattern of the delimiter flag does not occur in the fields between flags.
HDLC controller is designed to permit both synchronous and code transparent data transmission this control information reduces the possibility of errors.

16-bit address.
8 bit data 
And 16 bit CRC Check.

simulation result for final output at the receiver end for 8-bit data16-bit address and 16-bit CRC, with bit stuffing and removal of error in HDLC.

Use Xilinx ISE design suite to work on the program.
